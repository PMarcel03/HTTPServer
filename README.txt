Simple Python HTTP Server Project:

A lightweight, custom-built HTTP 1.1 server in Python, designed to serve static files from a specified web root directory.

##Introduction

This project implements a basic HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 1.1 server entirely from scratch using Python's 'socket' module.
The primary goal of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics of web communication, TCP/IP, and the HTTP protocol,
rather than relying on high level frameworks.

##Features
* TCP Listener Socket configured and functional
* Static File Serving: Serves HTML, CSS, Javascript and other static content from a configurable web root directory.
* HTTP/1.1 Compliance (Partial): implements core aspects of the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

##Inprogress Features
    * HTTP Parsing
    * Routing System
    * HTTP Response generation
    * More comprehensive error handling 
    * Message Board API
